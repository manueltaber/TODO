# // TODO
Keep track of the things you need to do

## Getting started

First of all you have to install the angular cli
````
> npm install -g angular-cli
````
Open /src afterwards and execute these commands

````
> npm install
````
````
> ng build
````
````
> ng serve
````

Everything should work fine now (probably)
